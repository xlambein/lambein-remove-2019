# Remove, Complete and Detect: Matrix Completion for Direct Imaging of Exoplanets

Source code for the paper "Remove, Complete and Detect: Matrix Completion for
Direct Imaging of Exoplanets" by Lambein et al. 2019.


## Requirements

You'll need Python 2.7 (yes I'm sorry ðŸ˜¢) and Octave (again, sorry) to run the scripts in this repository.

To set up everything, first you'll want to install and build the git submodule
for GRMF:

```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update
cd lib/grmf/exp-grmf-nips15
octave-cli --eval "install"
cd ../../../
```

After that, in a fresh Python virtualenv, install the requirements with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then you should be good to go!
